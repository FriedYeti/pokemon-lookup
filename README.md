# Pokémon Lookup

A small project using the [pokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to display Pokémon types, sprites, and abilities.
 
Supports adding and removing to a Favorites list and leaving notes/comments on each Pokémon's page.

Created in a few evenings to refresh my knowledge of HMTL/CSS/Javascript programming.
