# Pokémon Lookup

A small project using the [pokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to display Pokémon types, sprites, and abilities.
 
An working demo is available [here](https://friedyeti.github.io/pokemon-lookup/).

### Supports
* Creation and deletion of favorites and notes
* Persistent storage of favorites and notes through IndexedDB
* Easily expandable (all JSON data is there, just need to create additional handlers)

Created in a few evenings to refresh my knowledge of HMTL/CSS/Javascript programming and learn more about Javascript's asynchronous side.
